== Description ==

Smoother-Chat is probably the easiest plugin to add a ChatGPT based chat window to your Wordpress site via shortcode.

There are only 3 steps to do:

1. Add your OpenAI API Key in the Plugin settings  (Create an account here at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys/ "Get your OpenAI API key") and get your own API Key)
1. Set how your chat should behave ("You are a helpful, knowledge sharing chatbot who is expert in DIY camper van teaching.")
1. Add the shortcode [smoother-chat] to any page that should have the chat window in the lower right corner
